Running Chinmina locally is a crucial part of successfully contributing. Since
Chinmina acts as a bridge between Buildkite and GitHub though, local execution
has similar prerequisites to installing it into a standard environment.

This guide will walk you through the setup of GitHub and Buildkite, then
introduce running the server locally in Docker. It is possible to run the
executable directly, but this tends to make running the server more difficult.

## Setting up your local environment

Required tools:

2. [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) for local environment configuration
3. Docker (`docker compose`) to run the server on the local machine.
4. Go language and toolchain.

<Aside type="tip">

The Go environment in use needs to be able to build the version specified in the
project's `go.mod` file.

[Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is a useful tool for ensuring that you have
the right toolchain for this project, in such a way that it doesn't mess with
other projects.

</Aside>

## Setting up GitHub and Buildkite

Refer to the ["Getting Started" guide's](../guides/getting-started) sections on
Buildkite and GitHub for the creation of the Buildkite API key and the GitHub
application.

Collect the configuration values as suggested.

## Server configuration

<Steps>

1. Setup your local environment by creating a `.envrc.local` file, using the
   template provided in the repository's `.envrc` file. This file's contents will
   override any defaults set in `.envrc`.

2. Using the "Getting started" guide's [essential
   configuration](getting-started#chinmina-bridge-setup) section, fill in the
   suggested values in `.envrc.local`.

3. Run `direnv allow` to bring the updated configuration into the environment.

</Steps>

## Running the server

This project uses the venerable `make` as a build tool.

Run:

- `make build` to build the executables
- `make test` to ... run the tests
- `make docker` to start the system with Docker Compose, running Chinmina, the Buildkite agent and Jaeger.

When `compose` is running, the Builkite agents will process jobs from pipelines
in your test organization, and authenticate to GitHub. Jaeger is accessible to
observe the Chinmina telemetry.
