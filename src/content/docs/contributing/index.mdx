This project welcomes contributions! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding
features, improving documentation, or helping with testing, your help is
appreciated.

## Getting Started

<Steps>

1. **Find something to work on**: Browse the [outstanding
   issues](https://github.com/chinmina/chinmina-bridge/issues) for ideas, or
   open a new issue to discuss your proposed changes.
2. **Set up your environment**: Follow the [local development
   guide](./development) to get your development environment ready.
3. **Make your changes**: Write focused, well-tested code that follows the
   project's conventions.
4. **Submit a pull request**: Open a PR with a clear description of the changes
   and why they're needed.

</Steps>

## Contribution Standards

All contributions, whether written by hand or generated with AI assistance, must
meet the same standards.

### Pull Request Quality

- **Focused scope**: Each PR should address a single concern or feature. Large,
  unfocused PRs will likely be rejected or require splitting.
- **Well documented**: Explain the purpose and context of your changes in the PR
  description.
- **Well tested**: Include tests that demonstrate your changes work and don't
  break existing functionality.
- **Clean commit history**: Structure commits to make review easier. Related
  changes should be grouped logically.

### Code Quality

- Follow the project's code conventions
- Write clear code: favour simplicity and readability
- Include appropriate error handling
- Add comments where logic isn't self-evident, or a maintainer would benefit from
  additional context

<Aside type="note">
**Large PR size or lack of focus will likely result in a request to drop or change the PR.**

It's better to submit multiple smaller, focused PRs than one large PR covering
many concerns.
</Aside>

## AI-Generated Contributions

AI agent use for contributions is accepted under the same conditions as
handwritten contributions. If you use AI tools (such as GitHub Copilot, Claude,
Crush, or similar) to help write your contribution:

- You are responsible for the quality and correctness of the output
- You must review and understand all generated code before submitting
- The contribution must still be focused, well-documented, and well-tested
- **You must verify that the AI-generated output does not contain unattributed
  intellectual property from other sources**

AI-generated contributions that fail to meet quality standards, contain
unattributed code, or show signs of inadequate review will be require changes
before any thorough review is completed.

<Aside type="caution">
**Intellectual Property Responsibility**

Contributors must ensure their submissions don't contain code copied from
proprietary sources or code with incompatible licenses. This applies equally to
manually written and AI-generated code.

If you're uncertain about the origin of generated code, please investigate
before submitting.

## Review Process

Maintainers will review your PR for:

- Alignment with project goals
- Code quality and test coverage
- Documentation completeness
- Commit structure and clarity

Feedback may include requests for changes, clarifications, or discussion of
alternative approaches. This is a normal part of the process and helps maintain
project quality.
