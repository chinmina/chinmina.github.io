description: Details of all configuration options available.

Chinmina uses environment variables for all configuration, as it is expected that it will be deployed in a container runtime.

## Server

Configuration related to the core HTTP service.

###### `SERVER_PORT`

_(default: `8080`)_

The port that the Chinmina service will bind to on startup.

###### `SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS`

_(default: `25`)_

The number of seconds the server will wait for existing requests to complete
when shutting down. Shutdown will occur once requests complete or the timeout
occurs; whichever comes first.

###### `SERVER_OUTGOING_MAX_IDLE_CONNS`

_(default: `100`)_

For outgoing HTTPS requests, the maximum total number of idle connections that
are allowed.

###### `SERVER_OUTGOING_MAX_CONNS_PER_HOST`

_(default: `20`)_

For outgoing HTTPS requests, the maximum connections that may be made per host.
Given that Chinmina mainly targets Buildkite and GitHub API endpoints, this
number is somewhat higher than might otherwise be usual.

## Buildkite OIDC

###### `JWT_BUILDKITE_ORGANIZATION_SLUG` :badge[required]

The organization slug for your Buildkite organization. This slug is used for API
calls, and verifying OIDC tokens on incoming requests.

###### `JWT_AUDIENCE`

_(default: `app-token-issuer`)_

The audience that is expected on incoming OIDC tokens. This value must be supplied to `buildkite-agent oidc create`.

:::tip

Recommendation: `chinmina:your-github-organization`. This is specific to the
purpose of the token, and also scoped to the GitHub organization that tokens
will be vended for. `chinmina-bridge`'s GitHub app is configured for a
particular GitHub organization/user, so if you have multiple organizations,
multiple agents will need to be running.

:::

### Development settings

The following JWT settings are generally development only. In production, it's
expected that the default behaviour of retrieving the `jwks.json` directly from
Buildkite will be the preferred method.

###### `JWT_JWKS_STATIC`

A static literal JWKS file for local testing. Use "make keygen" to generate a new key pair.

The local `.envrc.local` file can reference the generated key as follows:

```bash
jwks="$(cat .development/keys/jwk-sig-testing-pub.json)"
export JWT_JWKS_STATIC="${jwks}"
```

###### `JWT_ISSUER_URL`

_(default: `https://agent.buildkite.com`)_

Testing only. The issuer URL expected on incoming OIDC JWT tokens.

## Buildkite API

###### `BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN` :badge[required]

The Buildkite token used to access the Buildkite REST API. Should only be
supplied the `read_pipelines` scope.

## GitHub API

:::tip

Either `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` or `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_ARN` is required.

`GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_ARN` is strongly recommended where possible (see [KMS configuration](../../guides/kms)).

:::

###### `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` :badge[required]

The GitHub Application private key in PEM format, supplied as text (not a file path).

###### `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_ARN` :badge[required]

The AWS KMS key (or alias) resource ARN that has been configured for use by Chinmina.

See the [AWS KMS setup and configuration](../../guides/kms) guide for more details.

###### `GITHUB_APP_ID` :badge[required]

GitHub App ID of the app itself.

###### `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` :badge[required]

The ID for the installation of the App in your organization.

###### `GITHUB_ORG_PROFILE`

The location of your organization profile, if in use. This should be a triplet
of the form `<OWNER>:<REPO>:<PATH_TO_FILE>`. No other format is accepted.

The contents of this organization profile must conform to the [organization profile configuration format][org-profile-config].

## Open Telemetry

###### `OBSERVE_ENABLED`

_(default: `false`)_

When `true`, Open Telemetry traces and metrics will be published on the
configured transport type (see `OBSERVE_TYPE`).

###### `OBSERVE_METRICS_ENABLED`

_(default: `true`)_

If the Open Telemetry target does not support metrics (e.g. Jaeger), set this to
`false`. Only relevent when when `OBSERVE_ENABLED` is true.

###### `OBSERVE_TYPE`

_(options: `grpc | stdout` default: `grpc`)_

Set the outgoing transport to use for telemetry. GRPC is the default; `stdout`
is only really useful for development situations where a telemetry server is not
available.

###### `OBSERVE_OTEL_LOG_LEVEL`

_(options: `debug | info | warn` default: `info`)_

Configure internal Open Telemetry SDK logging. Any invalid value will be
interpreted as disabled.

###### `OBSERVE_SERVICE_NAME`

_(default: `chinmina-bridge`)_

The identifying service name reported in traces and metrics.

###### `OBSERVE_TRACE_BATCH_TIMEOUT_SECS`

_(default: `5`)_

The number of seconds to wait for a batch of spans before sending to the
collector.

###### `OBSERVE_METRIC_READ_INTERVAL_SECS`

_(default: `60`)_

The number of seconds to wait between metric read and send attempts. A shorter
interval may be desirable in testing, or when higher precision is required.

###### `OBSERVE_HTTP_TRANSPORT_ENABLED`

_(default: `true`)_

If `OBSERVE_ENABLED` is also true, enable sub-traces for all outgoing HTTP
requests. This allows tracing of Builkite and GitHub API traffic. This is very
useful, but for some providers who charge by the number of spans, this may be
a costly operation.

###### `OBSERVE_CONNECTION_TRACE_ENABLED`

_(default: `true`)_

When true, outgoing HTTP requests will be annotated with details of the
connection process, e.g. DNS lookup time. Only effective when HTTP transport
tracing is enabled.

###### `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`

_(default: `http://localhost:4317`)_

The endpoint to which traces and metrics will be sent.

:::tip

Standard Open Telemetry configuration is supported. See the Open
Telemetry [exporter configuration][otel-exporter-config] for all configuration
variables available.
