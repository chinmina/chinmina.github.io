Chinmina Bridge can be integrated as a Git credentials helper, or used directly
to create a token.

## Git authentication via helper

:::tip

To use this Git authentication method, each Buildkite pipeline needs to be
configured with an **HTTPS Git URL** in the Buildkite pipeline settings.

If SSH is referenced, the credential helper is not used.

:::

There is a handy plugin that facilitates using Chinmina Bridge for Git
authentication: the [Chinmina Git Credentials][credentials-plugin] Buildkite
plugin.

There are two cooperating parts to the plugin:

1. An `environment` hook to configure a Chinmina Git credentials helper using
   environment variables.
2. A Chinmina Bridge Git credentials helper. This is a simple bash script that
   will be called by Git (as configured in the environment).

Chinmina Bridge has an endpoint that returns credentials in the Git credential
helper format.

:::note

When used as a standard plugin, the Git credentials plugin needs to be active on
**all** steps that pull the source repository. It is possible to do this on a
step-by-step basis, but it's ... repetitive.

Enabling at the agent level is recommended (see below).

:::

## How it works

The following gives a high-level overview of the actions performed when the
credential helper is configured in Git.

In essence, Git calls the Credential Helper, which defers to Chinmina
(authenticated with an OIDC token for this pipeline). Chinmina returns a result
in the Git credentials helper format containing the required username, and the
token created for the pipeline.

```d2 sketch=true title="sequence diagram showing Git authentication integration with Chinmina"
shape: sequence_diagram

buildkite-job: Buildkite Job
git: Git
credential-helper: Credential Helper
chinmina: Chinmina Bridge
buildkite-api: Buildkite API

buildkite-job.clone -> git.auth: clone
git.auth -> credential-helper.req: get credentials

credential-helper.req -> buildkite-api.token: request OIDC token
credential-helper.req <- buildkite-api.token: Buildkite OIDC token

credential-helper.req -> chinmina.helper: request GH token\n(using Buildkite OIDC token)
chinmina.helper -> buildkite-api.repo: get pipeline details
chinmina.helper <- buildkite-api.repo: pipeline repository
credential-helper.req <- chinmina.helper: scoped GitHub token

git.auth <- credential-helper.req: \"x-access-token\" /app-token

buildkite-job.clone <- git.auth: complete
```

## Configuration

### On pipeline steps

Like other Buildkite plugins, this plugin can be enabled on commands steps. For example:

```yml
steps:
  - command: ls
    plugins:
      - chinmina/chinmina-git-credentials#v1.0.2:
          chinmina-url: "https://chinmina-bridge-url"
          audience: "chinmina:your-github-organization"
```

In order for this plugin to work for a whole pipeline, it must be enabled on
every step. **This includes any steps configured in the [pipeline
configuration][pipeline-configuration].**

In practice, this becomes quite repetitive and prone to misconfiguration. The
only other option available is configuring the plugin on the agent: see below
for instructions.

### Enable on the agent (_all_ pipelines)

This method enables the plugin in the agent `environment` hook, using a plugin
version that has been downloaded in the agent `bootstrap`.

This will enable Chinmina Bridge authentication on all builds running on the
agent.

:::tip

If conditional activation is required, consider adding extra conditions to the
`environment` hook. For example, enable the plugin based on the presence of an
environment variable. The environment variable can be specified in the
pipeline's settings, enabling the plugin for all steps in a single pipeline.

:::

<Steps>

1.  Alter the agent `bootstrap` hook to clone the plugin source to the agent so
    it can be activated by any step.

    ```bash
    plugin_repo="https://github.com/chinmina/chinmina-git-credentials-buildkite-plugin.git"
    plugin_version="v1.0.2"
    plugin_dir="/buildkite/plugins/chinmina-git-credentials-buildkite-plugin"

    [[ -d "${plugin_dir}" ]] && rm -rf "${plugin_dir}"

    GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 \
    GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=advice.detachedHead \
    GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=false \
      git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --no-tags \
        --branch "${plugin_version}" -- \
        "${plugin_repo}" "${plugin_dir}"
    ```

2.  Call the plugin's `environment` hook directly from the agent's `environment`
    hook, specifying the plugin parameters directly.

    ```bash title="Execute plugin environment hook directly"
    chimina_default_url="https://chinmina.url-to-instance.io";
    chimina_default_audience="chinmina:your-org"; # needs to match Chinmina Bridge configuration
    BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_VENDOR_URL="${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_VENDOR_URL:-${chimina_default_url}}" \
      BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_AUDIENCE="${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_AUDIENCE:-${chimina_default_audience}}" \
        source /buildkite/plugins/chinmina-git-credentials-buildkite-plugin/hooks/environment
    ```

    :::note

    It is possible to clone the plugin in the `environment` hook as well, however
    this adds additional latency when every job starts.

    :::

</Steps>

### Parameters

#### `chinmina-url` (Required, string)

The URL of the [`chinmina-bridge`][chinmina-bridge] helper agent that vends a
token for a pipeline. This is a separate HTTP service that must accessible to
your Buildkite agents.

#### `audience` (string)

**Default:** `chinmina:default`

The value of the `aud` claim of the OIDC JWT that will be sent to
[`chinmina-bridge`][chinmina-bridge]. **This must correlate with the value
configured in the `chinmina-bridge` settings.**

A recommendation: `chinmina:your-github-organization`. This is specific
to the purpose of the token, and also scoped to the GitHub organization that
tokens will be vended for. `chinmina-bridge`'s GitHub app is configured for a
particular GitHub organization/user, so if you have multiple organizations,
multiple agents will need to be running.

## Chinmina token plugin

Another handy library plugin that facilitates fetching github token from Chinmina for the current repository or for an requested org profile: the [Chinmina Token][chinmina-token] Buildkite plugin.

There are two parts to the plugin:

1. An `environment` hook to configure the variables used by the `chinmina_token` script and  
   adding the script to the PATH.
2. A `chinmina_token` script. This is a simple bash script which either uses the cached buildkite oidc token from the `credential helper`
   if still available or generates a new one and perform a call to the `token` endpoint in Chinmina to fetch a Github token.

Chinmina Bridge has an `token` endpoint that returns credentials in JSON format.

## Configuration

### On pipeline steps

Like other Buildkite plugins, this plugin can be configured in the following way:

```yml
steps:
  plugins:
    - chinmina/chinmina-token#v1.0.0:
        chinmina-url: "https://chinmina-bridge-url"
        audience: "chinmina:your-github-organization"
```

In order for this plugin to work for a whole pipeline, it must be enabled on
every step. **This includes any steps configured in the [pipeline
configuration][pipeline-configuration].**

In practice, this becomes quite repetitive and prone to misconfiguration. The
only other option available is configuring the plugin on the agent: see below
for instructions.

### Usage

To get a GitHub token, then fetch a private GitHub release asset (example usage), would be the following:

```bash
# use the helper function to get a token
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(chinmina_token "org:profile-name")

# The GH CLI will use GITHUB_TOKEN as its authorization for any API requests:

# ... show this to the console
gh auth status

# ... download a release from a private repo
gh releases download --repo "${repo}" \
  --pattern "release-file=${arch}.zip" \
  --dir "${directory}" \
  "${tag}"
```

### Enable on the agent (_all_ pipelines)

This method enables the plugin in the agent `environment` hook, using a plugin
version that has been downloaded in the agent `bootstrap`.

This will enable the functionality to fetch Github token from Chinmina Bridge on all builds running on the
agent.

:::tip

If conditional activation is required, consider adding extra conditions to the
`environment` hook. For example, enable the plugin based on the presence of an
environment variable. The environment variable can be specified in the
pipeline's settings, enabling the plugin for all steps in a single pipeline.

:::

<Steps>

1.  Alter the agent `bootstrap` hook to clone the plugin source to the agent so
    it can be activated by any step.

    ```bash
    plugin_repo="https://github.com/chinmina/chinmina-token-buildkite-plugin.git"
    plugin_version="v1.0.0"
    plugin_dir="/buildkite/plugins/chinmina-token-buildkite-plugin"

    [[ -d "${plugin_dir}" ]] && rm -rf "${plugin_dir}"

    GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 \
    GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=advice.detachedHead \
    GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=false \
      git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --no-tags \
        --branch "${plugin_version}" -- \
        "${plugin_repo}" "${plugin_dir}"
    ```

2.  Call the plugin's `environment` hook directly from the agent's `environment`
    hook, specifying the plugin parameters directly.

    ```bash title="Execute plugin environment hook directly"
    BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_TOKEN_CHINMINA_URL="${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_TOKEN_CHINMINA_URL:-https://chinmina.url-to-instance.io}" \
    BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_TOKEN_AUDIENCE="${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_TOKEN_AUDIENCE:-chinmina:your-org}" \
        source /buildkite/plugins/chinmina-token-buildkite-plugin/hooks/environment
    ```

    :::note

    It is possible to clone the plugin in the `environment` hook as well, however
    this adds additional latency when every job starts.
