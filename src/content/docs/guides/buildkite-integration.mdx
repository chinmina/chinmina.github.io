Chinmina Bridge can be integrated as a Git credentials helper, or used directly
to create a token.

## Git authentication via helper

:::tip

To use this Git authentication method, each Buildkite pipeline needs to be
configured with an **HTTPS Git URL** in the Buildkite pipeline settings.

If SSH is referenced, the credential helper is not used.

:::

There is a handy plugin that facilitates using Chinmina Bridge for Git
authentication: the [Chinmina Git Credentials][credentials-plugin] Buildkite
plugin.

There are two cooperating parts to the plugin:

1. An `environment` hook to configure a Chinmina Git credentials helper using
   environment variables.
2. A Chinmina Bridge Git credentials helper. This is a simple bash script that
   will be called by Git (as configured in the environment).

Chinmina Bridge has an endpoint that returns credentials in the Git credential
helper format.

:::note

When used as a standard plugin, the Git credentials plugin needs to be active on
**all** steps that pull the source repository. It is possible to do this on a
step-by-step basis, but it's ... repetitive.

Enabling at the agent level is recommended (see below).

:::

## Configuration

### On pipeline steps

Like other Buildkite plugins, this plugin can be enabled on commands steps. For example:

```yml
steps:
  - command: ls
    plugins:
      - chinmina/chinmina-git-credentials#v1.0.2:
          vendor-url: "https://chinmina-bridge-url"
          audience: "chinmina:your-github-organization"
```

In order for this plugin to work for a whole pipeline, it must be enabled on
every step. **This includes any steps configured in the [pipeline
configuration][pipeline-configuration].**

In practice, this becomes quite repetitive and prone to misconfiguration. The
only other option available is configuring the plugin on the agent: see below
for instructions.

### Enable on the agent (_all_ pipelines)

This method enables the plugin in the agent `environment` hook, using a plugin
version that has been downloaded in the agent `bootstrap`.

This will enable Chinmina Bridge authentication on all builds running on the
agent.

:::tip

If conditional activation is required, consider adding extra conditions to the
`environment` hook. For example, enable the plugin based on the presence of an
environment variable. The environment variable can be specified in the
pipeline's settings, enabling the plugin for all steps in a single pipeline.

:::

<Steps>

1.  Alter the agent `bootstrap` hook to clone the plugin source to the agent so
    it can be activated by any step.

    ```bash
    plugin_repo="https://github.com/chinmina/chinmina-git-credentials-buildkite-plugin.git"
    plugin_version="v1.0.2"
    plugin_dir="/buildkite/plugins/chinmina-git-credentials-buildkite-plugin"

    [[ -d "${plugin_dir}" ]] && rm -rf "${plugin_dir}"

    GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 \
    GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=advice.detachedHead \
    GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=false \
      git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --no-tags \
        --branch "${plugin_version}" -- \
        "${plugin_repo}" "${plugin_dir}"
    ```

2.  Call the plugin's `environment` hook directly from the agent's `environment`
    hook, specifying the plugin parameters directly.

    ```bash title="Execute plugin environment hook directly"
    chimina_default_url="https://chinmina.url-to-instance.io";
    chimina_default_audience="chinmina:your-org"; # needs to match Chinmina Bridge configuration
    BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_VENDOR_URL="${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_VENDOR_URL:-${chimina_default_url}}" \
      BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_AUDIENCE="${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_CHINMINA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_AUDIENCE:-${chimina_default_audience}}" \
        source /buildkite/plugins/chinmina-git-credentials-buildkite-plugin/hooks/environment
    ```

    :::note

    It is possible to clone the plugin in the `environment` hook as well, however
    this adds additional latency when every job starts.

### Parameters

#### `vendor-url` (Required, string)

The URL of the [`chinmina-bridge`][chinmina-bridge] helper agent that vends a
token for a pipeline. This is a separate HTTP service that must accessible to
your Buildkite agents.

#### `audience` (string)

**Default:** `chinmina:default`

The value of the `aud` claim of the OIDC JWT that will be sent to
[`chinmina-bridge`][chinmina-bridge]. **This must correlate with the value
configured in the `chinmina-bridge` settings.**

A recommendation: `chinmina:your-github-organization`. This is specific
to the purpose of the token, and also scoped to the GitHub organization that
tokens will be vended for. `chinmina-bridge`'s GitHub app is configured for a
particular GitHub organization/user, so if you have multiple organizations,
multiple agents will need to be running.
